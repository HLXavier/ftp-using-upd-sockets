WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, p
roviding full-duplex communication channels over a
 single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was
 standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011. The
 current API specification allowing web applicatio
ns to use this protocol is known as WebSockets.
 It is a living standard maintained by the WHATWG 
and a successor to The WebSocket API from the W3C.
WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols ar
e located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend o
n TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC
 6455 states that WebSocket "is designed to work o
ver HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HT
TP proxies and intermediaries", thus making it com
patible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the W
ebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header
to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket.
The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between
a web browser (or other client application) and a
web server with lower overhead than half-duplex a
lternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating rea
l-time data transfer from and to the server. This 
is made possible by providing a standardized way f
or the server to send content to the client withou
t being first requested by the client, and allowin
g messages to be passed back and forth while keepi
ng the connection open. In this way, a two-way ong
oing conversation can take place between the clien
t and the server. The communications are usually d
one over TCP port number 443 (or 80 in the case of
 unsecured connections), which is beneficial for e
nvironments that block non-web Internet connection
s using a firewall. Similar two-way browserâ€“server
 communications have been achieved in non-standard
ized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet
 or Adobe Flash Player.
